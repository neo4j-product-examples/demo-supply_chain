# Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Demo

This demo models and analyzes pharmaceutical supply chains using Neo4j. It includes a sample dataset, graph schema, and Cypher queries for:

	•	Tracing product flow
	•	Analyzing supplier dependencies
	•	Performing batch traceability
	•	Identifying risks like bottlenecks and circular logistics

👉 Explore the demo in-depth: Go to [/walkthrough](./walkthrough/) for a guided explanation of use cases, queries, and how the AI Agent supports exploration.
