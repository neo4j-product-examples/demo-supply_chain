This demo models and analyzes pharmaceutical supply chains using Neo4j. It includes a sample dataset, graph schema, and Cypher queries for:

- Tracing product flow
- Analyzing supplier dependencies
- Tracking supplier risks and dependency chains
- Understanding APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) dependencies and connections
- Identifying risks like bottlenecks and circular logistics
